# NoSQL-challenge
# Establishment Analysis

This project aims to analyze establishments' data and perform various operations using MongoDB and Python.

## Prerequisites

- Python
- MongoDB 
- pymongo library 
- pandas library 

## Getting Started

1. Import the dataset:

- Ensure that you have the establishments dataset in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
- Create a MongoDB database and collection to store the data.
- Import the dataset into the collection using a MongoDB import tool or the MongoDB Compass interface.

2. Update the MongoDB connection details:

- Open the `config.py` file.
- Update the `MONGO_URI` variable with your MongoDB connection URI.

3. Run the code:

- Open the desired Python script (e.g., `main.py`) in your preferred IDE or text editor.
- Modify the code as needed (e.g., update query conditions, pipeline stages).
- Run the script to execute the desired operations on the establishments data.

## Examples

- `main.py`: Provides examples of common operations, such as finding establishments, updating records, and performing aggregations.

- `data_analysis.py`: Includes code snippets for conducting data analysis tasks on the establishment's dataset.
